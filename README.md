# Flowing Retail

This sample application demonstrates a simple order fulfillment system, decomposed into multiple independent components (like _microservices_).

## Lab04 

To run the **Choreography-based** version of the Flowing Retail project for lab04 you first need to be sure that all
the relevant projects have been built at least once:

```
  $ cd .\kafka\java\
  $ mvn clean install
```

Then you can execute:

```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose-kafka-java-choreography.yml up --build
```
from the directory [runner/docker-compose](runner/docker-compose).

## Lab07

To run the **Camunda-based** version of the Flowing Retail project for lab07 you need to execute:

```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose-kafka-java-order-camunda.yml up
```
from the directory [runner/docker-compose](runner/docker-compose).

## Lab11a

To run the **Zeebe-based** version of the Flowing retail project for lab11 you need to execute:
```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose-kafka-java-order-zeebe.yml up
```
from the directory [runner/docker-compose](runner/docker-compose). This uses the [order-zeebe](kafka/java/order-zeebe) project for handling the order workflow.
Hint: If you want to use the local Zeebe services you need to have the ''Self-managed local Zeebe'' configuration
active in your [application.properties](/kafka/java/order-zeebe/src/main/resources/application.properties) file. If you want
to use the hosted Camunda Cloud configuration you need to configure your Camunda Cloud credentials here.

## Lab11b

To run the **Zeebe-based** version of the Flowing retail project for lab11 you need to execute:
```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose-java-order-zeebe.yml up
```
from the directory [runner/docker-compose](runner/docker-compose). This uses Zeebo with JobWorkers in the individual services for handling the order workflow.

The rest of this README file is the original one provided by Bernd Rücker.

The repository contains code for multiple implementation alternatives to allow a broad audience to understand the code and to compare alternatives. The [table below](#alternatives) lists these alternatives.

The example respects learnings from **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, Event Driven Architecture (EDA) and **Microservices (µS)** and is designed to give you hands-on access to these topics.

**Note:** The code was written in order to be explained. Hence, I favored simplified code or copy & paste over production-ready code with generic solutions. **Don't consider the coding style best practice! It is purpose-written to be easily explainable code**.

You can find more information on the concepts in the [Practical Process Automation](https://processautomationbook.com/) book with O'Reilly.

## Architecture and implementation alternatives

The most fundamental choice is to select the **communication mechanism**:

* **[Apache Kafka](kafka/)** as event bus (could be easily changed to messaging, e.g. RabbitMQ): [](docs/architecture.png)
* **[REST](rest/)** communication between Services.
  * This example also shows how to do **stateful resilience patterns** like **stateful retries** leveraging a workflow engine.
* **[Zeebe](zeebe/)** broker doing work distribution.

After the communication mechanism, the next choice is the **workflow engine**:

* **Camunda Platform**
* **Zeebe as managed service on Camunda Cloud**

and the **programming language**:

* **Java**
* **Go**
* **JavaScript / TypeScript**

## Storyline

Flowing retail simulates a very easy order fulfillment system. The business logic is separated into the services shown above (shown as a [context map](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping)).

### Long running services and orchestration

Some services are **long running** in nature - for example: the payment service asks customers to update expired credit cards. A workflow engine is used to persist and control these long running interactions.

### Workflows live within service boundaries

Note that the state machine (_or workflow engine in this case_) is a library used **within** one service. If different services need a workflow engine they can  run whatever engine they want. This way it is an autonomous team decision if they want to use a framework, and which one:
